6. Adopting the Cloud Strategy
================================================================================

The Italian Cloud Strategy will be divided into subsequent phases
according to the timeline proposed below:

| **PHASE 1** - *Publication of the call for tenders for the
  implementation of the NSH*: By the end of 2021 at the latest, the call
  for tenders for the implementation of the NSH will be published.

| **PHASE 2** - *Procurement contract awarding and implementation of the
  NSH*: The awarding of the tender should take place by the end of 2022 at
  the latest.

| **PHASE 3** - *Migration of administrations*: Starting from the end of
  2022 at the latest, the migration of PAs to the NSH should begin and be
  completed by the end of 2025. During the migration phase, priority will
  be given to those Central Public Administrations that currently operate
  with their own data centres, classified as Category B, by AgIDâ€™s census
  of PA ICT assets (e.g. data centers with structural and/or
  organisational deficiencies or that do not guarantee service
  continuity).
